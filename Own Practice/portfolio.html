        <p>Prakash Bahadur Nepali is a first-year Bachelor of Computer Application student
             at LJ University in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, bringing with him a unique cross-
             cultural educational journey that began in his birthplace of Nepal. 
             He completed his 10th standard at Star Future Secondary School in Nepal 
             before relocating to India to pursue higher education, where he successfully
              completed his 12th standard from Niram High School in Ahmedabad. Now 
              embarking on his undergraduate studies in computer applications,
               Prakash is building a strong foundation in technology and programming
                driven by his passion for the digital world. His diverse educational 
                background across two countries has shaped his adaptable nature and 
                broadened his perspective, qualities that complement his academic 
                pursuits. As he progresses through his degree, Prakash is focused on
                 developing his technical skills and exploring the vast opportunities
                  within the field of computer science and application development.
